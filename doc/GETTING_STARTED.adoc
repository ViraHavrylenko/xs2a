= Getting started

== Prerequisites

- Java JDK version 11.x or later, Maven 3.x;
- Relational database for consent-management-system. PostgreSQL, Oracle and MariaDB are supported out of the box, the list can be extended. We recommend to use PostgreSQL 9.5 or later.
- Docker (Optional).


=== Clone git repository and build a project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a.git
$ cd xs2a
$ mvn clean install
```

=== Use docker-compose

There is docker-compose.yml in root folder which will help to run containers in docker.
Some images will be build from sources, some fetched prebuild from docker hub.
All liquibase DB settings will be applied automatically and you can skip the step `Run a Consent-Management-System server`.

Docker-compose runs containers:

* aspsp-xs2a_aspsp-profile (aspsp-profile-server);
* aspsp-xs2a_consent-management (cms-standalone-service);
* aspsp-xs2a_consent-management-postgres (Postgres DB);
* aspsp-xs2a_xs2a-standalone-starter (xs2a-standalone-starter).

Start docker compose:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

=== Run an ASPSP-Profile:
`Windows`
```
> cd aspsp-profile\aspsp-profile-server
> mvn spring-boot:run
```

`UNIX` (`BSD`, `Linux` or `MacOS`)
```bash
$ cd aspsp-profile/aspsp-profile-server
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

=== Run a Consent-Management-System server
First of all you need to setup a relational database for it.
We recommend to use PostgreSQL.
Default parameters for that DB one can find in the `liquibase.example.properties`:

|===
|Parameter   |Value

| DB Host     | localhost
| DB Port     | 5432
| DB Name     | consent
| DB Schema   | consent
| DB User     | cms
| DB Password | cms
|===

Setup a database and db schema.

Then create tables using liquibase:

`Windows`
```
> cd .\consent-management\cms-db-schema\
> copy liquibase.example.properties liquibase.properties
```

`UNIX` (`BSD`, `Linux` or `MacOS`)
```bash
$ cd consent-management/cms-db-schema
$ cp liquibase.example.properties liquibase.properties
$ mvn liquibase:update
```

Now, once PostgreSQL-server is running on port `5432` you may run consent-management-system server:
```bash
$ cd consent-management/cms-standalone-service
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--server_key=12345678
```
Open a browser on page [http://localhost:38080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:38080/swagger-ui.html)

=== Run a XS2A-Server
By default XS2A-library shall be packed with the ASPSP-Connector, that connects the library to the corresponding ASPSP-systems.

To start the XS2A do:

Open a browser on page [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

Now you may try to put some data using the xs2a-interface.
See some test scripts [for Postman](../scripts/tests/postman) or [Insomnia](../scripts/tests/insomnia) as a starting point.

=== Recommended Hardware Requirements

- CPU 2Cores;

- Memory 2GB;

- Free disk space 6GB*.

=== Deployment

Dockerfiles provided in the project allow to put the build artifacts into a docker images. Those images are to be
configured through your environment (documentation follows) to interact properly. We provide you also with public images on Docker hub.

Since most of our services are written in pure Java, you can also choose another ways to deploy the applications in your environment.
Please refer to the documentation pages of each service to perform its configuration.
