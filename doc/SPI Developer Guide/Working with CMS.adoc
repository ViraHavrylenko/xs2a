=== Using the CMS-PSU-API

CMS PSU API provides interfaces to be used by online-banking systems. Main purpose of these interfaces - providing
access to internal data of business objects stored in CMS database. Access to this API is provided via REST requests.
REST controllers classes are located in the `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.web.psu.controller` package.

CMS-PSU-API has 4 main parts which are implemented as separate REST controllers:

* ASPSP consent data part;
* AIS consent part;
* PIS payment part;
* PIIS consent part.

Below is the description of each controller with its endpoints and names of corresponding java source code methods.

==== ASPSP consent data controller

This controller has endpoints for handling ASPSP consent data.

* *GET /psu-api/v1/aspsp-consent-data/consents/{consent-id}* - reads ASPSP consent data by provided consent/payment ID. Corresponding java method - `getAspspConsentData`;
* *PUT /psu-api/v1/aspsp-consent-data/consents/{consent-id}* - updates ASPSP consent data by provided consent/payment ID. Java method - `updateAspspConsentData`;
* *DELETE /psu-api/v1/aspsp-consent-data/consents/{consent-id}* - clears ASPSP consent data by provided consent/payment ID. Method - `deleteAspspConsentData`.

More detailed ASPSP data handling is described
xref:./Implementing SPI-API.adoc[here].

==== AIS consent controller

This controller has endpoints for working with AIS consent entities and their attributes.

* *GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/{consent-id}* - returns AIS consent object by provided ID (ID should be internal). Corresponding java method is `getConsentByConsentId`;

* *GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/authorisation/{authorisation-id}* - returns authorisation object by its ID. Method - `getAuthorisationByAuthorisationId`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/consents* - returns list of AIS consents by provided `PSU-ID` header. Java method - `getConsentsForPsu`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/redirect/{redirect-id}* - returns AIS consent object by provided authorisation (redirect) ID. Method - `getConsentIdByRedirectId`.

==== PIS payment controller

This controller has endpoints for working with PIS payment entities and their attributes.

* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/{payment-id}* - returns PIS payment object by provided ID (ID should be internal). Corresponding java method is `getPaymentByPaymentId`;
* *PUT /psu-api/v1/payment/{payment-id}/authorisation/{authorisation-id}/status/{status}* - updates status of PIS payment authorisation. Java method - `updateAuthorisationStatus`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/{payment-id}/authorisation/psus* - returns map consisting of PSU data IDs (keys) and statuses of their authorisations for the given payment (values). Also, holds the type of authorisation for payment (`CREATED`/`CANCELLED`). Method for this - `psuAuthorisationStatuses`;
* *PUT /psu-api/v1/payment/{payment-id}/status/{status}* - switches the PIS payment status. The status should be provided as a path variable. Method - `updatePaymentStatus`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/authorisation/{authorisation-id}* - returns authorisation object by its ID; Method - `getAuthorisationByAuthorisationId`;
* *PUT /psu-api/v1/payment/authorisation/{authorisation-id}/psu-data* - updates PSU data for definite authorisation. Method - `updatePsuInPayment`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/cancellation/{payment-id}* - returns PIS payment object by provided cancellation ID. Used method - `getPaymentByPaymentIdForCancellation`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/cancellation/redirect/{redirect-id}* - returns PIS payment object by provided cancellation authorisation (redirect) ID. Method - `getPaymentIdByRedirectIdForCancellation`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/payment/redirect/{redirect-id}* - returns PIS payment object by provided authorisation (redirect) ID. Method - `getPaymentIdByRedirectId`.

==== PIIS consent controller

This controller has endpoints for working with PIIS consent entities and their attributes.

* *GET /psu-api/v1/piis/consents* - returns list of PIIS consent objects by provided header `PSU-ID`. Method name - `getConsentsForPsu`;
* *GET /psu-api/v1/piis/consents/{consent-id}* - returns PIIS consent object by its ID. Method - `getConsent`;
* *PUT /psu-api/v1/piis/consents/{consent-id}/revoke-consent* - revokes the definite PIIS consent (status switches to `REVOKED_BY_PSU`). In java - `revokeConsent`.

=== Using the CMS-ASPSP-API

CMS-ASPSP-API is an API for banks to make particular changes in CMS and to get needed information from it.

In order to do it use next endpoints in CMS-ASPSP-API:

* `GET aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/tpp/{tpp-id}` - get consents by TPP.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/psu` - get consents by PSU.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/account/{account-id}` - get consents by account.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/events` - get events for dates.
* `POST aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents` - create PIIS consent.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents` - get PIIS consents for PSU.
* `DELETE aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents/{consent-id}` - terminate PIIS consent.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents/tpp/{tpp-id}` - get PIIS consents by TPP.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents/psu` - get PIIS consents by PSU.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/piis/consents/account/{account-id}` - get PIIS consents by account ID.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/pis/payments/tpp/{tpp-id}` - get payments by TPP.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/pis/payments/psu` - get payments by PSU.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/pis/payments/account/{account-id}` - get payments by account ID.
* `PUT /aspsp-api/v1/pis/transaction-status/{payment-id}/status/{status}` - update payment status.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/tpp/stop-list` - get TPP stop list record.
* `PUT aspsp-api/v1/tpp/stop-list/block` - block TPP.
* `DELETE aspsp-api/v1/tpp/stop-list/unblock` - unblock TPP.
* `GET aspsp-api/v1/tpp/{tpp-id}` - get TPP info.

`PUT /aspsp-api/v1/pis/transaction-status/{payment-id}/status/{status}`:
on this endpoint you can update transaction status of payment by its payment ID.

In order to do this you should enter payment id and new transaction status as path variables,
also you can pass instance id as header, but it is not required.
