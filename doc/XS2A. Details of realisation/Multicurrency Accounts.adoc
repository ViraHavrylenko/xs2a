*Definition:* A multicurrency account is an account which is a collection of different sub-accounts which are all addressed by the same account identifier like an IBAN by e.g. payment initiating parties. The sub-accounts are legally different accounts and they all differ in their currency, balances and transactions. An account identifier like an IBAN together with a currency always addresses uniquely a sub-account of a multicurrency account.

The specification supports to address multicurrency accounts either on collection or on sub-account level. The currency data attribute in the corresponding data structure "Account Reference" allows to build structures like:

{"iban": "DE40100100103307118608"}

or

{"iban": "DE40100100103307118608",
 "currency": "EUR"}.

If the underlying account is a multicurrency account, then:

* the first reference is referring to the collection of all sub-accounts addressable by this IBAN, and

* the second reference is referring to the euro sub-account only.

*Multicurrency Accounts in Submission of Consents*: Multicurrency accounts are addressed by just using the external account identifier in the submission of a consent on dedicated accounts, without specifying a currency. Asking for the consent to retrieve account information data of a multicurrency accounts implies getting it for all sub-accounts.

*Multicurrency Accounts in Reading Accounts or Account Details*: The ASPSP will decide in its implementation whether to grant data access to a multicurrency account on aggregation level, on aggregation and sub-account level, or only on sub-account level. See examples below.

*Multicurrency Accounts in Reading Balances*: The consequence for this function is that an array of balances of all sub-accounts are returned, if a multicurrency account is addressed on aggregation level. The currency of the respective sub-account is implicitly provided as the currency of the balanceAmount element within the balance.

*Multicurrency Accounts in Reading Transactions*: The consequence for this function is that the list of transactions will contain all transactions of all sub-accounts, if a multicurrency account is addressed on aggregation level. In this case the payment transactions contained in the report may have different transaction currencies.

To fit the requirements one more value was added to ASPSP-profile named *"multicurrencyAccountLevelSupported"* with possible options:

* AGGREGATION;
* AGGREGATION_AND_SUBACCOUNT;
* SUBACCOUNT (by default).

This interface specification is acting on sub-accounts of multicurrency accounts in exactly the same way as on regular accounts. This applies to payment initiation as well as to account information.

*Remark:* The multi-currency account product is in use in some markets in Europe, e.g. in Online-Banking products within the Belgium market. The support of this functionality in the XS2A API is only applicable in these markets.
