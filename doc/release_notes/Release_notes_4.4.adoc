== Improve payment type validation

== Incorrect scaStatus for failed authorisation PIS/AIS/Payments-Cancellation

From now on, update PSU data and initiate endpoints for PIS, AIS and Payment-Cancellation return `scaStatus: failed` when
encountering `PSU_CREDENTIALS_INVALID`.

== Incorrect consent status for already used one time consent

From now on, all one-off consents (`recurringIndicator` = false and `frequencyPerDay` = 1) are being checked for
using all possible combinations of GET endpoints (accounts, balances, transactions). If all possible GET endpoints were
used - the consent receives the `EXPIRED` status.
