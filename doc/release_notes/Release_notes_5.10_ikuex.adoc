== Bugfix: In case of XML format payments the response type is still "applications/json"

From now on, content-type of payment initiation is being saved in CMS database.
When TPP retrieves payment information (`GET /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}`) this content-type is passed to SPI level and returns back to XS2A.
In case when content-type is absent in database (read old payments) this value will be obtained from `Accept` header.
If ASPSP doesn't provide payment content-type TPP will receive content-type that was passed to ASPSP.
If there is no information about content-type from the above-mentioned resources (database, `Accept` header, SPI response) TPP will receive default value `application/json`.
