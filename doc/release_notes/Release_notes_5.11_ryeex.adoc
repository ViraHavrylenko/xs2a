== Bugfix: Wrong response for consent creation with additionalInformation ownerName

From now on, request Create accounts consent (`POST /v1/consents`) will return Response code `400 SERVICE_INVALID` if none account addressed within the additionalInformation attribute is also addressed by at least one of the attributes "accounts", "transactions" or "balances".

== Bugfix: Read Account List with balances request returns error for Consent on Account List of Available Accounts with ownerName
From now on, request Read Account List with parameter `withBalance=true` works correct (`GET /v1/accounts?withBalance=true`)) for accounts which were created with field
`availableAccountsWithBalance` as `allAccountsWithOwnerName`.
