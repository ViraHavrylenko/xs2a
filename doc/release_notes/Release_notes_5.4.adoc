== Implement support of Multicurrency Accounts

From now on, XS2A supports multicurrency accounts.
It can be enabled in ASPSP Profile by setting `multicurrencyAccountLevelSupported` property to `AGGREGATION_AND_SUBACCOUNT` or `AGGREGATION` value.
When TPP asks for account list information or account information, ASPSP can return `null` in `currency` field.
This means that this is a multicurrency account and XS2A marks `currency` field with `XXX` text.
