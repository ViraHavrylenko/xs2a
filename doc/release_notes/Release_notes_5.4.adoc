== Implement support of Multicurrency Accounts

From now on, XS2A supports flows for multicurrency accounts.
A multicurrency account is an account which is a collection of different sub-accounts which are all addressed by the same account identifier like an IBAN by e.g. payment initiating parties.
The sub-accounts are legally different accounts and they all differ in their currency, balances and transactions.
An account identifier like an IBAN together with a currency always addresses uniquely a sub-account of a multicurrency account.
ASPSP can grant data access to multicurrency account on SUBACCOUNT, AGGREGATION or AGGREGATION_AND_SUBACCOUNT level by setting `multicurrencyAccountLevelSupported` property in ASPSP-Profile.

== Incorrect scaStatus for failed authorisation PIS/AIS/Payments-Cancellation

From now on, update psu data and initiate endpoints for PIS, AIS and Payment-Cancellation return correct scaStatus in case of failed authorisations.
