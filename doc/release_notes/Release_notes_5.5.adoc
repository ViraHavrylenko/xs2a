== Removed deprecated columns TppRedirectUri from TppInfo

From now on, deprecated columns `redirect_uri`, `nok_redirect_uri`, `cancel_redirect_uri`,
`cancel_nok_redirect_uri` are removed from `tpp_info` table in CMS.

== Removed deprecated `PsuIdData` from `confirmConsent`, `rejectConsent`, `revokeConsent` in `CmsPsuAisService`

From now on, deprecated method `authorisePartiallyConsent` is removed from `CmsPsuAisService`
and deprecated headers `psuId`, `psuIdType`, `psuCorporateId`, `psuCorporateIdType` are removed from
`authorisePartiallyConsent` method in `CmsPsuAisController`.

== Refactoring: Extracted ASPSP Profile web-endpoints into separate module

From now on, endpoints for accessing and updating ASPSP Profile are located in `aspsp-profile-web` module.

== Bugfix: incorrect response for start authorisation request with password but without PSU-ID in header Explicit AIS/PIS

From now on, when you try to start authorisation for payment/consent with password and without `PSU-ID` in header,
you'll receive the same response as it would be with `PSU-ID` in header.

== Add supporting standing order report

From now on, it's possible to return standing order report on Get Transaction List request(`GET /v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/transactions`) in JSON format.

This endpoint is offering a list of all standing orders related to a dedicated payment account in case of `bookingStatus` parameter equals `information`.
The support the `information` feature is optional for the ASPSP. Error code will be responded if it is not supported.
The query parameters `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `withBalance`, `deltaList` and `entryReferenceFrom` will be ignored and have no effect on the
result.

Only `application/JSON` for response content type is supported.

== Revoke all consents when account is closed

From now on, created endpoint in cms-aspsp-api for revocation AIS and PIIS consents of account or PSU data.
If PSU closes an account in the bank - then ASPSP can use this endpoint. AIS and PIIS consents will change status to RevokedByPsu.

== Provided implementation of delta access for transaction list request

Delta access was implemented for transaction list request `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions`.
Parameters `entryReferenceFrom` and `deltaList` are provided to SPI level in `SpiTransactionReportParameters` object.
Also `acceptMediaType`, `withBalance`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `bookingStatus` were moved from method parameters to `SpiTransactionReportParameters` object.
Parameter `dateFrom` is not mandatory when TPP sends `entryReferenceFrom` or `deltaList` parameter and it is supported by ASPSP.
When TPP sends transaction list request with period parameters (`dateFrom` and `dateTo`) and one of a delta access parameters (`entryReferenceFrom` or `deltaList`)
and this parameter is not supported by ASPSP, then request will be processed only with period parameters.

== Bugfix: validation of authorisation sub-resources

From now on, while creating authorisation for PIS/AIS/PIS cancellation, some business validation occurs due to the
specification demands. Main ideas:

* For one PSU SCA – only one authorisation per one initial request for one PSU-ID may be active.
* For multilevel PSU SCA – for one initial request there may be active as many authorisations as many PSUs should make SCA, but only one authorisation for one particular PSU-ID.





== Refactoring: Removed duplication and complexity for PisAuthorisationProcessorServiceImpl and PisCancellationAuthorisationProcessorServiceImpl

Removed code duplication and allocated common parts of the mentioned services.
