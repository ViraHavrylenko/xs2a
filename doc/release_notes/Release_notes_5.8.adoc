== Allow custom payment validation

From now on, XS2A allows to validate custom country-specific payments.
Payment body and payment business validators were affected by this changes.
To configure validation for another country, SPI developer should provide custom implementation of `de.adorsys.psd2.validator.payment.CountryValidatorHolder` interface.

== Migrate to common payment object

From now on, XS2A is switching to using common payment object instead of type-specific payments (single, periodic and bulk).
Common payment is stored in CMS and transferred to SPI as byte array without parsing specific fields, just as it was received from TPP.
To provide backward compatibility for previous versions new modules were added:

[source]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
    <artifactId>xs2a-payment-support-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
    <artifactId>cms-payment-support-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

`xs2a-payment-support-impl` should be added as a dependency to connector for using type-specific implementations of `PaymentSpi` (`SinglePaymentSpi`, `PeriodicPaymentSpi`, `BulkPaymentSpi`).

`cms-payment-support-impl` should be added as a dependency to custom CMS application for mapping common payment to existing type-specific payment models.

To handle only common payments, previously mentioned dependencies should be replaced with the following ones:

[source]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
    <artifactId>xs2a-payment-common-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
    <artifactId>cms-payment-common-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In case of using common implementations, all payments will be forwarded to `CommonPaymentSpi`.

== Implement auto reloading for profile

From now on, there is the possibility of auto reloading the profile. By default, the profile isn't reloaded.
The exact specification about needed timeframes, between each reload, is customizable in the `application.properties` via
`aspsp-profile-reload.cron.expression` (as cron expression).

== Feature: compatibility with new Berlin group yaml specification file

All XS2A model files and REST controllers were updated in accordance with Berlin group yaml file version 1.3.5.

== Move AuthenticationObject to xs2a-core

Usages of `Xs2aAuthenticationObject` and `SpiAuthenticationObject` were substituted with `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.core.authorisation.AuthenticationObject`

== Feature: Add new data attribute instructionIdentification for all standard payment types

From now on, `instructionIdentification` field was added to all standard payment types.
Also in case `instructionIdentification` field exceeds the maximum length of 35 symbols TPP will receive `400 Bad Request` error with `FORMAT_ERROR` code.
New `instructionIdentification` field is stored in CMS database and is provided to SPI level.

== Bugfix: PIIS request not filtered by TPP consent

From now on, PIIS consents are correctly filtered by TPP during Funds Confirmation Request (`POST /v1/funds-confirmations`).

== Optional verification of URLs in headers according certificate domain
From now on, URL validator is optional. And it can can be controlled by parameter `checkUriComplianceToDomainSupported` in ASPSP Profile.
When this parameter is `TRUE` then verification will check differences between domain from TPP Certificate and headers with URL (TPP-Redirect-URI, TPP-Nok-Redirect-URI and TPP-Notification-URI).
If TPP URIs are not compliant, then request is not rejected and response has tppMessages with text "TPP URIs are not compliant with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate".

== Adopt data type Max512Text to Max500Text

From now on, length of text fields in some TppMessage classes was changed from 512 characters to 500 (In accordance with Errata for BG specification).

== Fixing acceptance of past validUntil date provided through CMS-PSU-API

From now on, providing a validUntil date, that is prior to the current date gets rejected on
calling `PUT /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/{consent-id}/save-access`.

== Log Request ID and Internal Request ID via SLF4J MDC

From now on, InR-ID and X-Request-ID values are provided to the logs via SLF4J's Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).
These values are no longer provided explicitly in XS2A log messages, but they can be retrieved by the logging framework from MDC.
This change also affects `access-log` and `request-log`, meaning that log messages in these loggers no longer contain InR-ID and X-Request-ID.

Default log configuration file for Logback in XS2A has been changed to include these IDs.
In case of using custom logging configuration, SPI developer should adjust existing configuration to get and display stored IDs from MDC.
Internal Request ID(logged as InR-ID) and X-Request-ID are stored in the MDC under `internal-request-id` and `x-request-id` keys.

These IDs are also propagated from XS2A to CMS and ASPSP profile services via `X-Request-ID` and `X-Internal-Request-ID` headers and can be retrieved from MDC using already mentioned keys.
