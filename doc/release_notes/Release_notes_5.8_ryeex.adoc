== Optional verification URLs in headers according certificate domain
From now on, URL validator is optional. And it can can be controlled by parameter `checkUriComplianceToDomainSupported` in ASPSP Profile.
When this parameter is `TRUE` then verification will check differences between domain from TPP Certificate and headers with URL (TPP-Redirect-URI, TPP-Nok-Redirect-URI and TPP-Notification-URI).
If TPP URIs are not compliant, then request is not rejected and response has tppMessages with text "TPP URIs are not compliant with the domain secured by the eIDAS QWAC certificate of the TPP in the field CN or SubjectAltName of the certificate".


== Adopt data type Max512Text to Max500Text

From now on, length of data in class fields was changed form 512 characters to 500 (In accordance with Errata for BG specification)
