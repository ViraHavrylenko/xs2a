==  Add errorful response `400 SCA_INVALID` for AIS and PIS flows concerning confirmation code

If confirmation of authorisation is mandated by the ASPSP profile and any of the following endpoints are called
for the second time, assuming that the first, successful, call resulted in the authorisation switching its sca status to
either `FINALISED` or `FAILED`, then this endpoint will now return with `400 SCA_INVALID`.

Affected endpoints:

* `PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`
* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`
* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/cancellation-authorisations/{cancellationId}`
